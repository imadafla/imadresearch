      title: "Evaluating passive PCM performance in building envelopes for semi-arid climate: Experimental and numerical insights on hysteresis, sub-cooling, and energy savings",
      authors: "Ait Laasri, I., Charai, M., Es-sakali, N., Mghazli, M. O., & Outzourhit, A. (2024)",
      journal: "Journal of Building Engineering",
      abstract: "This study evaluates the performance of macro-encapsulated Phase Change Materials (PCMs) integrated into building envelopes for semi-arid climates, focusing on typical Moroccan construction using hollow concrete blocks. The primary objective is to assess the discrepancies between experimental and numerical analyses, particularly in hysteresis, sub-cooling, and energy savings. Given the widespread reliance on numerical tools like EnergyPlus for PCM simulations, the accuracy of manufacturer-provided latent heat values is investigated. The methodology involves constructing two identical test buildings, one equipped with PCM panels and another as a reference. Experimental data were collected in June 2023, assessing temperature fluctuations and energy savings. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) tests at varying scanning rates were conducted to analyze PCM behavior, including hysteresis and sub-cooling effects. Numerical simulations were then performed to compare energy performance. Besides, the results reveal that sub-cooling significantly limits PCM efficiency, with only 43 % of the PCM's latent heat capacity utilized. At the same time, hysteresis was found to be negligible in the field test. Cooling energy consumption was reduced by 20 %, with a corresponding 2.3 °C reduction in temperature fluctuations. However, the PCM's latent heat potential is underutilized due to sub-cooling. This research underscores the need for conducting DSC measurements at specific scanning rates to reflect regional climate conditions and suggests that simulation models should adjust latent heat utilization of the PCM. The study advocates for the use of composite PCMs, which could mitigate sub-cooling and enhance overall performance. These findings contribute to improving PCM integration in passive building designs, offering practical recommendations for better energy efficiency in semi-arid climates.",

      journal: "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews",
      abstract: "This review discusses macro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) as a major contributing factor in the development of future sustainable and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. This work emphasizes the investigation of various phase change materials, which are essential to unlocking macro-encapsulated PCM’s full potential while taking into consideration its thermal characteristics, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, this work promotes novel heat exchanger designs for phase change materials, such as the use of macro-encapsulation in bricks, wallboards, plates and storage tanks for active and passive implementations in order to improve PCM performance and effectiveness in building applications. Besides, the utilization of topology optimization techniques is a promising direction due to capacity to produce complex, bio-inspired structures and significantly speed up heat transfer rates. Topology optimization can be used to create effective PCM containers and innovative heat exchangers for passive and active systems that serve to heat and cool both space and water. Nevertheless, building thermal management is required to further improve the effectiveness of this solution, by integrating renewable energy sources and sophisticated control techniques, leading to sustainable and adaptable solutions.",

      title: "Energy performance assessment of a novel enhanced solar thermal system with topology optimized latent heat thermal energy storage unit for domestic water heating",
      authors: "Ait Laasri, I., Charai, M., Mghazli, M. O., & Outzourhit, A. (2024)",
      journal: "Renewable Energy",
      abstract: "In this study, we introduce an innovative approach by incorporating a Topology-Optimized Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage (TO-LHTES) unit with fins into a solar water heating system. Employing EnergyPlus software, we initially assess the energy and power requirements essential for meeting domestic hot water needs within the Moroccan context. Afterward, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses explore diverse Phase Change Materials (RT35, RT50, and RT60) under varying operational conditions, including injected temperature, velocity, and stored temperature. Our investigation extends to different climates, evaluating the energy savings potential. The study's outcomes reveal the remarkable efficacy of the enhanced solar system featuring the TO-LHTES unit, particularly with specific configurations—such as an injected temperature of 20 °C, injected velocity of 0.02 m/s, stored temperature of 80 °C, and RT50 as the chosen Phase change material. Given the poor thermal conductivity of many PCMs, effective heat distribution and storage necessitate innovative methods. While various finned heat exchanger structures have been explored in existing literature, a notable gap exists in non-intuitive heat exchanger concepts specifically tailored for LHTES units. This work contributes by presenting an innovative TO-LHTES unit design, advancing the understanding and applicability of latent heat storage in solar water heating systems. Importantly, a maximum energy savings of 63.2% was achieved.",

      title: "Energy efficiency and hygrothermal performance of hemp clay walls for Moroccan residential buildings: An integrated lab-scale, in-situ and simulation-based assessment",
      authors: "Es-sakali, N., Charai, M., Kaitouni, S. I., Ait Laasri, I., Mghazli, M. O., Cherkaoui, M., ... & Ukjoo, S. (2023)",
      journal: "Applied Energy",
      abstract: "Hemp-based building envelopes have gained significant popularity in developed countries, and now the trend of constructing houses with hemp-clay blocks is spreading to developing countries like Morocco. Investigating the hygrothermal behavior of such structures under actual climate conditions is essential for advancing and promoting this sustainable practice. This paper presents an in-depth experimental characterization of a commercial hemp-clay brick that has been exposed to the outdoor environment for four years, in addition to field measurements on a building scale demonstration prototype. Additionally, the study simulates 17 representative cities to assess the hygrothermal performance and energy-saving potential in each of Morocco's six existing climate zones, using the EnergyPlus engine. The experimental campaign's findings demonstrate excellent indoor air temperature and relative humidity regulation within the hemp-clay wall building, leading to satisfactory levels of thermal comfort within hemp-clay wall buildings. This is attributed to the material's good thermal conductivity and excellent moisture buffering capacity (found to be 0.31 W/mK and 2.25 g/m2%RH), respectively). The energy simulation findings also point to significant energy savings, with cooling and heating energy reductions ranging from 27.7% to 47.5% and 33.7% to 79.8%, respectively, as compared to traditional Moroccan buildings.",
