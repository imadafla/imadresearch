      journal: "Automation in Construction",
      abstract: "This paper presents a computational framework for transforming building facades into active climate-responsive systems through an integrated automation architecture. The study's primary goal is to maximize energy efficiency by using real-time Model Predictive Control to organize the synergy between phase change materials (PCMs) and switchable insulation systems (SIS). A key contribution is an autonomous hybrid envelope, driven by a decision support system, implemented using a framework that bridges EnergyPlus with a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) and a genetic algorithm. The methods involved numerical modeling validated against experimental data with high precision to automate SIS actuation. Key results demonstrate that an intelligent control system achieved an 84.08% total energy reduction over uninsulated baselines and a 53.16% improvement over static insulation. With a 25 ms inference speed and a 5-s optimization loop, the framework provides a computationally efficient and scalable solution for the automated management of constructed facilities in diverse climates.",

      authors: "Es-sakali, N., Ait Laasri, I., Er-retby, H., & Mghazli, M. O. (2026).",
      journal: "Energy Conversion and Management",
      abstract: "Hot-climate cities face increasing challenges in achieving resilient pathways toward net-zero carbon emissions while ensuring thermal comfort, energy security, and resource efficiency. This study introduces a hydrogen-integrated net-zero energy district framework that couples passive building design strategies, active energy systems, and water reuse measures with a district-scale hydrogen energy hub. Using a developed open-source hydrogen simulation model (H2UrbanPlus), a newly planned district of 22 residential buildings is simulated under five design scenarios combining photovoltaics, passive shading, green roofs, and hydrogen-based storage. Results show that hydrogen plays a pivotal role in enabling seasonal balancing and resilience: district self-sufficiency rises by up to 85.6%, annual carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by 159 tonnes annually, and the system achieves near-carbon neutrality. Techno-economic evaluation demonstrates that hydrogen integration, when coupled with urban passive and water-energy synergies, lowers the effective levelized cost of electricity and improves the net present value of district investments. By providing a first district-scale co-simulation of passive, active, hydrogen, and water-recovery systems in a semi-arid hot-climate context, this study delivers new quantitative evidence on the role of hydrogen-enabled energy hubs in supporting resilient, low-carbon, and self-sufficient urban districts, offering actionable insights for planners and policymakers shaping future net-zero and hydrogen-transition strategies.",

      journal: "Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments",
      abstract: "HVAC systems in hot climates face significant energy consumption challenges, necessitating strategies for efficiency improvements. This study introduces a computationally efficient integrated reduced-order modeling framework for assessing phase change material (PCM) thermal energy storage in HVAC systems, specifically comparing PCM integration at the evaporator or condenser components. The framework combines a building thermal resistance–capacitance 3R2C network, a vapor-compression R410a refrigeration thermodynamic cycle model, and PCM-air heat exchanger models. Experimental validation of the building 3R2C model in a test facility in Benguerir, Morocco, yielded a 99.3% correlation between predicted and measured thermal performance across multiple cycles in a hot semi-arid climate. The HVAC and PCM heat exchanger models were validated using existing experimental studies in literature. Afterwards, the models were strategically fitted for integration with a building 3R2C network in Python, enabling rapid annual simulations and quick parametric optimization. Yearly performance analysis revealed that PCM integration at the condenser side improves the system coefficient of performance COP by 22.7% and reduces compressor energy consumption by 12.5%. In contrast, evaporator-side PCM integration offers a 13.3% reduction in cooling energy through effective thermal load shifting while ensuring steady COP performance. These results help HVAC engineers and building designers to choose the best PCM integration strategy based for their specific needs, either by enhancing HVAC efficiency through condenser-side integration or by managing energy use with evaporator-side solutions in hot climate applications.",

      title: "Integrated modeling and multi-parameter analysis of packed bed latent heat storage for climate-responsive domestic hot water systems",
      authors: "Kattan, M. A., Ait Laasri, I., Ait Ousaleh, H., Mghazli, M. O., & Faik, A. (2026).",
      journal: "Journal of Energy Storage",
      abstract: "The integration of latent heat thermal energy storage into solar water heating systems (SWHS) is a promising approach to enhance solar energy utilization and reduce auxiliary energy consumption under variable demand and climatic conditions. However, the impact of coupling SWHS with packed bed latent heat storage (PBLHS) units and rule-based control strategies remains insufficiently explored. This study investigates the effects of climatic conditions, domestic hot water (DHW) demand profiles, packed bed geometry, and phase change material (PCM) melting temperature on the performance of a SWHS equipped with a flat plate solar collector, a water tank, a PBLHS unit, a thermostatic mixing valve, and an auxiliary electric boiler. A fully integrated numerical model is developed in MATLAB and governed by a rule-based control strategy. A parametric campaign of 660 simulation cases is conducted across six climates, five DHW profiles, three packed bed heights, and seven PCM melting temperatures, including reference cases without latent storage. The results show that DHW demand timing strongly influences performance, with midday oriented profiles yielding the highest energy gains. Warmer and sunnier climates enhance system performance, while smaller packed beds combined with a PCM melting temperature near 45 °C provide optimal thermal matching with DHW requirements. The best configuration achieves energy gains of up to 84.6% weekly and 71.7% annually compared to the reference system. Overall, the proposed modeling framework highlights the strong potential of PBLHS to improve SWHS performance and provides practical design guidelines for climate and demand adapted systems. These findings support researchers, system designers, and decision makers by providing clear design and operational guidelines for advancing the implementation of PBLHS in SWHS.",

      authors: "Charai, M., Oubaha, S., Ait Laasri, I., Es-sakali, N., & Mghazli, M. O. (2025)",
      journal: "Journal of Energy Storage",
      abstract: "This study introduces a novel gypsum-to-gypsum concept that enables the seamless integration of thermal storage functionality into gypsum boards using cold-bonded gypsum aggregates (CBAs) as PCM carriers. Herein, the PCM selected, technical-grade paraffin, exhibited a melting point of ~28 °C, suitable for semi-arid building envelope applications. A reproducible water-controlled granulation method was developed to address the rapid setting behavior of gypsum, comparing intermittent water spraying and continuous linear feeding. The latter demonstrated superior granulation performance, achieving ~95 % yield with over 40 wt% of granules within the target 4–8 mm size range. Optimal granule formation occurred at water-to-binder ratios between 19.8 and 22.2 %. Sodium bicarbonate foaming was found to increase total porosity (46.5 to 52.1 %) and decrease loose density (821 to 699 kg/m3), but simultaneously reduced accessible porosity (35.4 to 28.8 %), thereby limiting PCM impregnation. Non-foamed CBAs achieved the highest PCM uptake (28.4 wt%) following vacuum impregnation at 120 °C for 30 min, yielding form-stable composites with a latent heat capacity of 71.4 J/g. Gypsum boards incorporating 40 vol% CBAs met the EN 13279-1 standard, identifying this substitution level as optimal. This formulation also showed improved acoustic performance, with a peak sound absorption coefficient of 0.6 at 1 kHz. Field testing conducted in a rooftop test cell under semi-arid climate conditions showed that PCM-enhanced boards reduced indoor surface temperatures by up to 10 °C and delayed peak heat transfer. Post-exposure DSC confirmed the PCM retained its phase change performance. Deployable on existing manufacturing workflows, the proposed process can offer a scalable pathway for producing phase-change gypsum boards.",

      authors: "Ait Laasri, I., Charai, M., et al. (2024)",
      journal: "Journal of Building Engineering",
      abstract: "This study evaluates the performance of macro-encapsulated Phase Change Materials (PCMs) integrated into building envelopes for semi-arid climates, focusing on typical Moroccan construction using hollow concrete blocks. The primary objective is to assess the discrepancies between experimental and numerical analyses, particularly in hysteresis, sub-cooling, and energy savings. Given the widespread reliance on numerical tools like EnergyPlus for PCM simulations, the accuracy of manufacturer-provided latent heat values is investigated. The methodology involves constructing two identical test buildings, one equipped with PCM panels and another as a reference. Experimental data were collected in June 2023, assessing temperature fluctuations and energy savings. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) tests at varying scanning rates were conducted to analyze PCM behavior, including hysteresis and sub-cooling effects. Numerical simulations were then performed to compare energy performance. Besides, the results reveal that sub-cooling significantly limits PCM efficiency, with only 43 % of the PCM's latent heat capacity utilized. At the same time, hysteresis was found to be negligible in the field test. Cooling energy consumption was reduced by 20 %, with a corresponding 2.3 °C reduction in temperature fluctuations. However, the PCM's latent heat potential is underutilized due to sub-cooling. This research underscores the need for conducting DSC measurements at specific scanning rates to reflect regional climate conditions and suggests that simulation models should adjust latent heat utilization of the PCM. The study advocates for the use of composite PCMs, which could mitigate sub-cooling and enhance overall performance. These findings contribute to improving PCM integration in passive building designs, offering practical recommendations for better energy efficiency in semi-arid climates.",

      abstract: "This review discusses macro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) as a major contributing factor in the development of future sustainable and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. This work emphasizes the investigation of various phase change materials, which are essential to unlocking macro-encapsulated PCM’s full potential while taking into consideration its thermal characteristics, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, this work promotes novel heat exchanger designs for phase change materials, such as the use of macro-encapsulation in bricks, wallboards, plates and storage tanks for active and passive implementations in order to improve PCM performance and effectiveness in building applications. Besides, the utilization of topology optimization techniques is a promising direction due to capacity to produce complex, bio-inspired structures and significantly speed up heat transfer rates. Topology optimization can be used to create effective PCM containers and innovative heat exchangers for passive and active systems that serve to heat and cool both space and water. Nevertheless, building thermal management is required to further improve the effectiveness of this solution, by integrating renewable energy sources and sophisticated control techniques, leading to sustainable and adaptable solutions.",

      abstract: "In this study, we introduce an innovative approach by incorporating a Topology-Optimized Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage (TO-LHTES) unit with fins into a solar water heating system. Employing EnergyPlus software, we initially assess the energy and power requirements essential for meeting domestic hot water needs within the Moroccan context. Afterward, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses explore diverse Phase Change Materials (RT35, RT50, and RT60) under varying operational conditions, including injected temperature, velocity, and stored temperature. Our investigation extends to different climates, evaluating the energy savings potential. The study's outcomes reveal the remarkable efficacy of the enhanced solar system featuring the TO-LHTES unit, particularly with specific configurations—such as an injected temperature of 20 °C, injected velocity of 0.02 m/s, stored temperature of 80 °C, and RT50 as the chosen Phase change material. Given the poor thermal conductivity of many PCMs, effective heat distribution and storage necessitate innovative methods. While various finned heat exchanger structures have been explored in existing literature, a notable gap exists in non-intuitive heat exchanger concepts specifically tailored for LHTES units. This work contributes by presenting an innovative TO-LHTES unit design, advancing the understanding and applicability of latent heat storage in solar water heating systems. Importantly, a maximum energy savings of 63.2% was achieved.",

      abstract: "Hemp-based building envelopes have gained significant popularity in developed countries, and now the trend of constructing houses with hemp-clay blocks is spreading to developing countries like Morocco. Investigating the hygrothermal behavior of such structures under actual climate conditions is essential for advancing and promoting this sustainable practice. This paper presents an in-depth experimental characterization of a commercial hemp-clay brick that has been exposed to the outdoor environment for four years, in addition to field measurements on a building scale demonstration prototype. Additionally, the study simulates 17 representative cities to assess the hygrothermal performance and energy-saving potential in each of Morocco's six existing climate zones, using the EnergyPlus engine. The experimental campaign's findings demonstrate excellent indoor air temperature and relative humidity regulation within the hemp-clay wall building, leading to satisfactory levels of thermal comfort within hemp-clay wall buildings. This is attributed to the material's good thermal conductivity and excellent moisture buffering capacity (found to be 0.31 W/mK and 2.25 g/m2%RH), respectively). The energy simulation findings also point to significant energy savings, with cooling and heating energy reductions ranging from 27.7% to 47.5% and 33.7% to 79.8%, respectively, as compared to traditional Moroccan buildings.",
